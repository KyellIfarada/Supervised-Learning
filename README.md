# Supervised-Learning
 
This project involves implementing supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning techniques for
density estimation and classification. The project focuses on a subset of the MNIST dataset
containing images of digits "0" and "1". The project involves four tasks: feature extraction, parameter
calculation, implementation of Na√Øve Bayes classifiers, and prediction of labels for the test data using
the classifiers. Finally, calculating the accuracy of the predictions.
